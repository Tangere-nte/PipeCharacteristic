# Mathematics and Physics Behind FlowSolver

1) Solving for Flow
  To solve using calculate_p_flow function to obtain flows and pressures from the given sinks' pressures, sources' flows, and pipe characteristics

2) Solving Pipe Characteristic
  To solve pipe characteristics using calculate_pipe_characteristic function to obtain pipe characteristics from the given pressures, and sources' flows for a tree graph.
